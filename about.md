# About Me

I'm flattered you care!

My name is Nabil Hassein. I'm currently living in New York City and attending the summer 2013 batch of [Hacker School](http://hackerschool.com). I am a native of Northern Virginia, where I spent my entire life until I moved to New York to study mathematics and computer science at [NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/) (during which time I learned at least as much by reading obsessively about politics and related subjects, and working part-time for four years at [P.S. 363](http://tnsny.org/)). After graduating from NYU in 2012, I spent a year teaching high school math in the Mississippi Delta before returning to New York.

[My first post](posts/hello-world.html) can help you get to know me a little better if you're interested; just know that it's not representative of what I plan to post on this website. It's highly personal even as it paints an incomplete picture of who I am, which is one of the many factors that made me hesitant to post it publicly; but I always think it's a major loss when I can't find out anything about the author of an interesting document, so it would be hypocritical for me to hide myself from you out of a misplaced sense of modesty, since I aspire to hold and deserve your interest.

I make use of [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nabilhassein) and [Github](https://github.com/nabilhassein), so check me out there if you're into that kind of thing.

You can get in touch with me, about anything, at <nabil.hassein@gmail.com>. I'd love to hear from you!


# About This Website

I intend to write primarily about technical matters of interest to specialists in the fields I'm working in or studying at any given time, and about the broader issues of technology, culture, and politics that affect all of us. Although I don't plan to write very much about myself, what makes issues important is their impact on our lives, and as I don't believe myself to be exempt from the influence of large and impersonal forces, I may write about my own life when I think it's a useful window on widely relevant topics. I rarely attempt objectivity; I prefer to bring my own perspective to the fore so that you can take it into account when evaluating my arguments. You can blame [Jay Rosen](http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/09/18/jennings.html) for that. That said, I usually try to compose pieces which can stand on their own, with no need for the reader to think about the identity of the writer. I love the classic style of essays and letters, which the blog can allow many more people to participate in than was historically the case, but as my technical skill develops, and as time permits, I also hope to use the new possibilities of modern technology to communicate in ways that were previously impossible, an ambition eloquently described by thinkers like [Bret Victor](), [

This is a static site I created with [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/), the [source of which can be found here](). I serve it from my [Linode VPS](https://www.linode.com) using [nginx](http://nginx.org/en/).
